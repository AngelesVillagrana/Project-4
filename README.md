# Final Project - Credit Card Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview

This project involves the implementation, training, and evaluation of a data model using Python. The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized before modeling. The model uses data retrieved from either SQL or Spark and aims to achieve at least 75% classification accuracy or an R-squared value of 0.80.

## Requirements Met For Completion

### Data Model Implementation

- **Python Script**: The script is responsible for initializing, training, and evaluating the model.
- **Data Preparation**: The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Data Source**: The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark.
- **Model Performance**: The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power, achieving at least 75% classification accuracy or an R-squared value of 0.80.

### Data Model Optimization

- **Optimization Process**: The iterative changes made to the model and their impact on performance are documented within the Python script.
- **Performance Display**: The overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script.
